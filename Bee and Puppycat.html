I based her design off of multiple outfits she wears in the show. This was also the first time I tried this type of lighting.

                <p>This was the design process. I didn’t focus on the lineart and proportions as much because my main goal was the outfit and colors, though my main inspiration was the design on the top. I decided to use that hairstyle but make the stars in her hair to glow, and though you can’t see it in the final drawing I wanted to keep the bows on her skirt pockets. I also exaggerated the different lengths of her socks, and made her shoes platform heels.</p></div>

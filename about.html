        <div class="row-1"> <p> My name is Asha McCray, I'm an aspiring character designer, character animator and show runner! I have always been an artist I started drawing as soon as I could pick up a pencil and just never stopped. Animation had  played a huge part of my life and once I realized it was an actually career option I made it my goal to some day have one of my stories come to life. Character design is my specialty I've been designing characters since middle school and I think as of this year I have created at least 50 characters each with their own story and universe!</p>
             <p>While I have yet to do any professional work I have completed all 12 years of primary school, while there I have designed one of the covers of my highschool's art magazine, as well as a mural for my senior project. I am currently in the process of getting my bachelor's degree in digital arts at LaSalle University. I am mostly self-taught i've only taken a week long traditional animation course at Moore College of art when I was 13, and a traditional drawing class at the Philadelphia academy for fine arts which lasted for about 1 month.</p>
